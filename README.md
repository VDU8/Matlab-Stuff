# Matlab-Stuff
This projects were part of my Software Computing course where I learned about Fuzzy Logic Controllers and got accustomed to MATLAB.

In one of the projects a Fuzzy logic Controller was designed to predict the ideal wash time based on different inputs provided to them, such as 
Types of Clothes, Detegent, Dirt, Mass, Temperature and Water Level which gave the output of Washing Time

In other project I learned about Hebbian and Delta learning rules in MATLAB
